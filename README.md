# _Villakulla_
* _Villakulla is the name of the playground of Estelle Slegers Helsen, freelancer for cultural projects. My passion is connecting people to each other, to their roots in the past and the present, and to the beauty of life itself. I do so contributing to a variety of social and cultural projects._
* _As a freelancer I mostly work home-based. I am currently sharing my time between Aardenburg (The Netherlands) and Ghent (Belgium) but will move to live and work in the East Midlands (United Kingdom) in Q4 2018._
* _Making data open and visible is my latest quest. Doing so for other professionals: cultural heritage, tourism and historical scientists. For them to search, add and edit cultural heritage data on different subjects and themes. I love to work with data on historical events, bibliography, points of interest, people, organisations..._
